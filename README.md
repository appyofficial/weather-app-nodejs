# Weather Node App
My february 2020 goal is to extend my frontend knowledge to the backend with the help of nodeJS. 

I am self teaching myself and therefore built this node weather app which takes arguments from the command line and fetching weather details from dark sky api and location coordinates from mapbox. 

To use, just run the node index file followed by city/address

```
node index.js malm√∂
